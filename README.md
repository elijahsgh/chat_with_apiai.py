# Chat with API.ai

This is a very simple demonstration project that you can use to submit queries to API.ai and receive a response back that is both echoed to the screen and sent for text-to-speech processing (also through API.ai).

There is also a very compact and easy to use module available at https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-python and also available through pip.

Find out more at http://api.ai

## What to do

Type your query and watch what happens.  Responses that include speech will be sent to API.ai to be turned into speech.

## What you'll need

Log in to API.ai and get your key for your agent.  That needs to go in credentials.py.
